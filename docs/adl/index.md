## Decisions

We have chosen **Nuxt v3** on 2022-11-30.

## Process

You can find more about ADL and ADRs [here](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/blob/main/README.md).  
Decision-making process is based on [systemic consensing](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/systemic-consensing/)
([a longer description](https://systemicconsensus.blogspot.com/2012/11/white-paper-systemic-consensing-first.html))
with initial step for defining criteria as used in [convergent facilitation](https://rebeltoolkit.extinctionrebellion.uk/books/building-2021-strategy/page/convergent-facilitation).

1. Define problem.
2. List criteria.
3. List options.
4. Describe options.
5. Identify objections (first voting).
6. Address objections and enhance options.
7. Make final decision (second voting).
